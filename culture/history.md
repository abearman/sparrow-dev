##Our History

It would be remiss of us to describe our present-day culture without describing our past. As Stephen Colbert once said, “There’s an old saying about those who forget history. I don’t remember it, but it’s good.”  We couldn’t agree more.

In the spirit of remembering the past, I have taken it upon myself to throw it back to 2012. This post is particularly fitting since today is a Thursday, and the throwback Thursday hashtag \#tbt is trending worldwide, and we are trendy people. 

Our story begins on September 17, 2012: the first day of freshman new student orientation. We were all welcomed into our freshman dorm Twain by the staff (including our RCC Alex Popof, fellow CS 210 alum and Warriors lover). We were bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, lanyard-wearing freshman with a questionable sense of style.

Full disclosure: Catherine and I actually met in junior year of high school (2011), when we both did the same summer program. We never hung out. Yet we gravitated towards each other for all large-group photos:

Regardless, when we all met in Twain our freshman year, we knew something good was brewing, although at the time, we didn’t know what. In an effort to figure out our paths in life, we embarked on a three-year long journey. In the midst of our soul-searching, we shared so many memories together: football games, minimal-effort Halloween costumes, camping, hiking, concerts, hackathons, dinners, adventures in SF, and so much more.

Now, three years later, we finally know what our purpose in life is. We were meant to create Sparrow, the indoor autonomous drone navigation system that opens up a whole new realm of possibility. Needless to say, we’re excited to see Sparrow take off.

And thankfully, I’ve stopped wearing that godforsaken lanyard.
