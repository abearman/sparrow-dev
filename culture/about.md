**Let's talk about drones.** When we think about drones, we usually imagine military UAVs or hobbyist kits we give our dads for Christmas. But drones have been taking off elsewhere. What began as a niche hobby has grown into a multi-billion dollar market.

Several companies have already been experimenting in this exciting space. The technology that is already out there falls into three main categories: hardware, drone OS, and outdoor navigation applications.

What we noticed about the current technology was that the primary method for drone navigation is GPS. But GPS only works reliably in outdoor settings. **This means that right now, you can't fly your drone indoors.** Even if drones had access to GPS indoors, it wouldn't be precise enough to face obstacles such as furniture, walls, and people.

**Enter Sparrow.** 

Our goal is to provide safe indoor drone navigation, without the help of a human operator. Indoor drone navigation technology could provide value in a variety of different domains, including prison security, inspection of hazardous environments, such as mines, sewers, and nuclear reactors, guidance for the visually impaired, and warehouse inventory management.

Let's talk more about warehouse inventory management. For humans, this is a time-consuming and dangerous process.  It is also expensive. Let's take Costco as a case example. Costco does a major inventory of each one of its stores twice a year, with 80 people working graveyard shifts, for a week, in 700 warehouses. If this task could be fully automated by drones, Costco could shift from a periodic to a continuous inventory system, improve business intelligence, and at the same time, save up to **$95 million dollars.**

With our system, given a 2D or 3D mapping of an environment, a user will be able to define flight paths to navigate the space with safety and precision. Rather than relying on GPS, we will use the drone’s onboard camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope in order to navigate. We’re starting out with warehouse inventory, because warehouses provide a tractable environment for testing and developing.

**But, at the end of the day, we’re creating a platform.** 

Sparrow is an add-on module that allows you to customize an off-the-shelf drone to navigate indoor paths. Follow us on Twitter @SparrowEng for updates!
