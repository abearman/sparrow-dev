### Project Synopsis: 

Sparrow is an environment agnostic drone navigation system with the goal of allowing drones to fly autonomously and with stability in new and dynamically changing environments. Our platform allows a drone to integrate multiple sensor inputs including GPS, motion tracking, and depth sensing techniques to localize in urban/indoor spaces. While there are many applications for our drone technology, we have focused initially on search and rescue (SAR). With our client, SAR operators can focus their searches, receive live video, and manually explore before isolating key areas to further investigate with more expensive assets such as helicopters or human search teams.
