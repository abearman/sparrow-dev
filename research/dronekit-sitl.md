# DroneKit SITL
The SITL (Software In The Loop) simulator allows you to create and test DroneKit-Python apps without hardware. SITL can run natively on Linux (x86 architecture only), Mac and Windows, or within a virtual machine. The sections below explain how to install and run SITL, and how to connect to DroneKit-Python and Ground Stations at the same time.

#### Installation
The tool is installed (or updated) on all platforms using the command:

```
pip install dronekit-sitl -UI
```
