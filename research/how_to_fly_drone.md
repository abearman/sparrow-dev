## Flight Modes


## Taking off

Once Solo and the controller are both powered on, (and a GPS connection has been established, if Solo is on a GPS mode), the controller will prompt you to hold the Fly button to start Solo’s motors. Hold Fly to activate the motors.

#### Right Joystick
Use the right stick to fly Solo forward, back, left, and right. These movements are relative to Solo’s current orientation, so always maintain awareness of Solo’s forward-facing direction before using right-stick controls.
