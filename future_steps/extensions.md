# Future Extensions

The Sparrow SAR system could be extended in many different ways. We distinguish future development
steps into two categories: drone and application.

On the drone side:

* Improved integration of non-GPS localization
* Smarter dynamic flight adjustment (i.e. collision avoidance, path adjustment)
* Additional integration of data collection sensors into the drone platform (wide-range and higher resolution front facing camera, downward facing camera, IR camera, etc.)
* Long development goal: develop custom drone hardware with new controller software specifically designed with environment-agnostic operation in mind

On the application side:
* Multiple drone control to allow for greater area coverage
* Integration with existing logistic and field awareness systems
* Loiter mode to allow drone to continually fly around an area while keeping its camera focused on a specific target
* 3D environment mapping using the Tango's built-in capabilities
