## End of Quarter Test Summary (6/1)

One of our goals for Sparrow was to see tangible improvement on our quantitative metrics from the time of launch week to the end of the quarter. To that end, we wanted to have another opportunity to have a target user test our prototype in week 10 and to take the subsequent survey, to see if we made any improvement. On 6/1, we tested on Sam Gussman, one of Kevin Mott's partners (for Kevin Mott's survey responses, please check out the launch_week_test_1.md doc). When testing with Sam, we saw immediate improvements with our product, particularly with regard to ease of use and robustness of our product; there were no crashes, and Sam had a much easier time picking up the controls due to the instructional overlay, so this was already an improvement from our launch week test. We had Sam try out manual controls, setting waypoints and navigating to them, and predefined SAR paths, as well as some of our added functionality such as being able to preview and scale the SAR paths, and being able to see a summary view of pinned objects of interest. We then talked to him about his experience and had him take our survey. The survey results are as follows:

How intuitive was the app on the whole, on a scale from 1 to 10? 7

How easy was it to understand how to fly a pre-loaded SAR path? 10

How easy was it to understand how to maneuver the drone in real time? 10

How much value do you think this application would provide for SAR operations? 7

Did you feel safe using the app and drone? 10

Which aspects of the app did you find most intuitive? "Using the SAR pattern was easy to figure out."

Which aspects of the app did you find least intuitive? "Waypoints didn't work how I thought, it worked as more of a destination point; wanted to be able to put multiple waypoints without immediately going to them."

What functionality did you wish to see in the app that wasn't there? "A satellite map to be able to see trees."

Can you imagine other SAR-specific features that you would like to see present in the app? "Sharing, that would be useful for coordination."

Would you have liked more flexibility with the pre-loaded SAR paths? "Maybe the ability to be able to circle an area and search it."

Were you aware of what sort of path would be flown before you selected a particular SAR path? "Yup."

Overall, we were very pleased with the results! Our product showed clear improvement from just a few weeks back during our test with Kevin, especially in terms of the value we were adding with our features, the ease of use of the user interface, and the robustness of our system. His main comment was that he wished to be able to set multiple waypoints without having the drone immediately travel to them, a feature which we plan to include this week. He also expressed interest in being able to delete a waypoint, the same way we have enabled the ability to be able to cancel an SAR path after the preview. Nonetheless, we definitely consider this end of quarter test as a success and are excited to close out this quarter strong.
