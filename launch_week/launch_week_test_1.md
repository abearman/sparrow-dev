## Launch Week Summary (5/12)

For our launch week, we launched our app on Kevin Mott, a valuable contact with the profile of our target customer. Kevin is an Army Captain selected to the General Wayne A. Downing Scholarship; he has a wealth of combat experience learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has experience running SAR operations. He is currently at Stanford University studying International Policy.

We met Kevin and his colleague Alvin to have them test our first prototype version of the application, which contained preloaded SAR paths, waypoint navigation, map view updates, video feed, pin dropping, and manual controls. We presented him with a sequence of scenarios to set the scene and gauged the ease with which he was able to complete the tasks. 

Upon completing the scenarios, we presented Kevin with a survey and gathered some key takeaways. He found the lateral movement functionality to be most intuitive and quickly understood how to use it (either by tapping or pressing and holding). He cited the relative nature of the altitude/rotation slider as being least intuitive, mentioning that he would have preferred an absolute scale on the sliders instead. He saw the core value in the application as being the ability to run predetermined SAR paths, to gather video feed, and to be able to drop pins when having found people or items of interest. He mentioned that he would have liked to see a preview of the SAR plan on a map to understand the scale, and to be able have a map view of pinned objects of interest. He mentioned our application could tie in to a visual recognition system in the future, which would be able to automatically detect people. Here are some quanitative results from the survey we presented him:

How intuitive was the app on the whole, on a scale from 1 to 10? 6

How easy was it to understand how to fly a pre-loaded SAR path? 8

How easy was it to understand how to maneuver the drone in real time? 8

How much value do you think this application would provide for SAR operations? 8

Did you feel safe using the app and drone? 9

This is a good start, but there is certainly much room to improve. We're looking forward to pushing forward with our development, making some of the changes Kevin suggested, and improving these metrics in our next few iterations.
