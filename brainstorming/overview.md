## Brainstorming

**Why do we think this idea is exciting?**

We think that using drones in a warehouse setting provides multiple benefits, including the following:

- Integrate communication with vendors
- Can operate daily (vs. annually or 2x annually) at negligible additional cost
- Identify and fix physical and system inventory errors before they have business impact
- Generate real-time maps of your warehouse
- Report missing or stolen stock immediately
- Physical safety for workers (no people on forklifts)
- Reduce human error

**What were particularly exciting insights during our brainstorming and benchmarking?**

We discovered certain pain points.

- **Problem**: Customers misplace items. **Impact**: Lost revenue; this takes place daily at all hours of the day.
- **Problem**: Full inventory sweep is time-consuming. **Impact**: Safety, overtime pay, biannual or annual (legally mandated).
- **Problem**: Canâ€™t do inventory very often. **Impact**: More up to date counts, can order low-stock items earlier.
- **Problem**: Item retrieval is slow. **Impact**: Wasted time to figure out where items went. **Solution**: Warehouse mapping

**What value are we adding?**

We considered Costco as a case study. The average Costco warehouse is 143,800 square feet... this is a huge space to walk over. Costco uses 40 groups of 2 people, working a week from 9 PM to 1 AM, twice a year, for its main full-warehouse inventory sweep. If you do the math, this comes out to 2240 man hours each time we take inventory, so 4480 man hours a year. With the average employee wage being $21/hour and $31.50 for overtime pay at 1.5x the normal rate, this comes out to $141,120 a year for a single warehouse to take inventory. There are 698 Costco warehouses, so this means $98,501,760 a year for Costco. If we compare this to the cost of 700 drones, where each one is $5000, this involves a one-time cost of $3,500,000. Thus, we have a **total added monetary value of $95,001,760** and **total added time of 3,127,040 hours**.

**What is our minimum viable product?**

Our minimum viable product would be a remote-controlled drone that takes photos as it goes along. We brainstormed a number of solutions involving the drone and involving computer vision.

Solutions involving the drone (ordered by best case to worst case):
- Fully automated navigation
- Path input
- Follow tape & input height
- Following a person
- Remote control

Solutions involving computer vision (ordered by best case to worst case):
- CV-based counting of items
- Scanning barcodes or RFIDs
- CV detection of item presence/absence
- Take photos for human inspection
 
**What products or solutions are doing something well that is related to our project?**

InventAIRy and DroneScan are the best we can find. These products assume it knows the height, and assumes uniform spacing. Currently these products do not involve autonomous drone navigation.

**Why is our team well positioned to do something great?**

Together, we have a variety of skills, including computer vision, AI, systems, and design. We think our diversity of skills makes us particularly well-suited to this project.
