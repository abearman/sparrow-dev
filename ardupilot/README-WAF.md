# WAF Build #

Ardupilot is gradually moving from the make-based build system to
[Waf](https://waf.io/).

To keep access to Waf convenient, use the following alias from the
root ardupilot directory:

```bash
alias waf="$PWD/modules/waf/waf-light"
```

You can also define the alias or create a function in your shell rc file (e.g.
`~/.bashrc`).

You can read the [Waf Book](https://waf.io/book/) if you want to learn more
about Waf.

## Calling waf ##

Waf should always be called from the ardupilot's root directory.

Differently from the make-based build, with Waf there's a configure step
to choose the board to be used (default is `sitl`):

```bash
# Configure the Linux board
waf configure --board=linux
```

Waf build system is composed of commands. For example, the above command
(`configure`) is for configuring the build. Consequently, in order to build, a
"build" command is issued, thus `waf build`. That is the default command, so
calling just `waf` is enough:

```bash
# Build programs from bin group
waf

# Waf also accepts '-j' option to parallelize the build.
waf -j8
```

To clean things up, use the `clean` or `distclean` command:

```bash
# Clean the build products, but keep configure information
waf clean

# Clean everything, will need to call configure again
waf distclean
```

Using git to clean the files also work fine.

To list the task generator names that can be used for the option `--targets`,
use the `list`command:

```bash
waf list
```

## Program groups ##

The programs in ardupilot are categorized into the following groups:

 - bin: *the main binaries, that is, ardupilot's main products - the vehicles and
   Antenna Tracker*
 - tools
 - examples: *programs that show how certain libraries are used or to simply
   test their operation*
 - benchmarks: *requires `--enable-benchmarks` during configurarion*
 - tests: *basically unit tests to ensure changes don't break the system's
   logic*

There's also a special group, called "all", that comprises all groups.

All build files are placed under `build/<board>/`, where `<board>` represents
the board/platform you selected during configuration. Each program group has a
folder with its name directly under `build/<board>/`. Thus, a program will be
stored in `build/<board>/<group/`, where `<group>` is the group the program
belongs to. For example, for a linux build, arducopter will be located at
`build/linux/bin/arducopter`.

## Building a program group ##

Ardupilot adds to waf an option called `--program-group`, which receives as
argument the group you want it to build. For a build command, if you don't pass
any of `--targets` or `--program-group`, then the group "bin" is selected by
default. The option `--program-group` can be passed multiple times.

Examples:

```bash
# Group bin is the default one
waf

# Build all vehicles and Antenna Tracker
waf --program-group bin

# Build all benchmarks and tests
waf --program-group benchmarks --program-group tests
```
### Shortcut for program groups ###

For less typing, you can use the group name as the command to waf. Examples:

```bash
# Build all vehicles and Antenna Tracker
waf bin

# Build all examples
waf examples
```

## Building a specific program ##

In order to build a specific program, you just need to pass its path relative
to `build/<board>/` to the option `--targets`. Example:

```bash
# Build arducopter
waf --targets bin/arducopter

# Build vectors unit test
waf --targets tests/test_vectors
```

### Shortcuts for vehicles ###

Vehicles can be built in the common single program building way (example: `waf
--targets bin/arducopter`). But that is too much typing :-), we provide
shortcut commands for vehicles:

```bash
# Build arducopter
waf copter

# Build arduplane
waf plane

# Build ardurover
waf rover
```

## Checking ##

The command `check` builds all programs and then run the relevant tests. In
that context, a relevant test is a program from the group "tests" that makes
one of the following statements true:

 - it's the first time the test is built since the last cleanup or when the
   project was cloned.
 - the program had to be rebuilt (due to modifications in the code or
   dependencies, for example)
 - the test program failed in the previous check.

That is, the tests are run only if necessary. If you want waf to run all tests,
then you can use either option `--alltests` or the shortcut command
`check-all`.

Examples:

```bash
# Build everything and run relevant tests
waf check

# Build everything and run all tests
waf check --alltests

# Build everything and run all tests
waf check-all
```

## Make wrapper ##

There's also a make wrapper called `Makefile.waf`. You can use
`make -f Makefile.waf help` for instructions on how to use it.

## Command line help ##

You can use `waf --help` to see information about commands and options built-in
to waf as well as some quick help on those added by ardupilot.
